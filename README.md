A simple scrapper written in Java to fetch all of the reviews of an app from Apple iOS website.

Apart from scrapping, it also analyzes the data to perform keyword extractions to get generic sentiments of the reviewers, suggestions, etc. 

Scrapper works as of last commit date, but it may not work anymore.
