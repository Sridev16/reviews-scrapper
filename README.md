A simple scrapper written in Java to fetch all of the reviews of an app from Apple iOS website.

Writes the polled data to an excel file.

Apart from scrapping, it also analyzes the data to perform keyword extractions to get generic sentiments of the reviewers, suggestions, etc. 

Added Google Cloud's Natural Language API for entity analysis to find and label fields within review comments and then sentiment analysis to understand customer opinions.

Scrapper works as of last commit date, but it may not work anymore.
